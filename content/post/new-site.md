I've finally finished most of the customizations I want for my new site!

The template is based off the [Erblog](https://github.com/ertuil/erblog) Hugo template, though (of course) with a lot of under the hood modifications.

I also finalized my [CV](/cv) which was made using the [Orbit](https://github.com/aerohub/hugo-orbit-theme) theme.

For future reference (for both you and me), here's a [Markdown demo](../markdown-demo) showing how various elements are rendered.

Over the next few weeks, I plan to post various projects/demos relating to statistics on this page.

Stay tuned for more! :)
